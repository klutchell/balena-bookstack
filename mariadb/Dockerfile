# Abuse the healthcheck cmd by having it backup our database on a schedule.
# This is cleaner than installing a separate cron/timer service in the image.
# It also has less overhead than running a separate sqldump container/service.
# However this is NOT what healtchecks were designed to do so this is a hack.
# For now run the backup every 10 minutes and keep 1 per each day of the week.
